### Fill in the required environment variables

After you click on the "Deploy" button, you will see a modal pop-up where you can fill in the required environment variables.

Here are the environment variables you need to fill in:

- OpenAI API key: Your OpenAI API key to get responses from OpenAI.

- Mr.ðŸ†– AI Domain: A free subdomain with `.zeabur.app` suffix.

- MinIO Public Domain: A free subdomain with `.zeabur.app` suffix for yout MinIO web port to enable public access for the uploaded files.

### Select a region and deploy

After you fill all the required environment variables, select a region where you want to deploy your Mr.ðŸ†– AI Database and click on the "Deploy" button.

You will see another modal pop-up where you can see the deployment progress.

### Configure Logto

After the deployment is done, you need to configure your Logto service to enable authrization.

Access your Logto console with the console domain you just binded, and then create a `Next.js 14(App router)` application to get the client ID and client secret, and fill in the cors and callback URLs. You can check [this document](../advanced/auth.mdx) for a more detailed guide.

Fill in those variables into your Mr.ðŸ†– AI service on Zeabur, here is a more detailed guide for [editing environment variables on Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/docs/deploy/variables).

For detailed configuration of Logto, refer to [this document](/docs/self-hosting/advanced/auth/next-auth/logto).

### Access your Mr.ðŸ†– AI Instance

Press on the `Mr.ðŸ†– AI-Database` and you can see the public domain you just created, click on it to access your Mr.ðŸ†– AI Database.

You can also bind a custom domain for your services if you want, here is a guide on how to [bind a custom domain on Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/docs/deploy/domain-binding).
